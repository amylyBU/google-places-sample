# google-places-sample
A simple application using Google's Places API (https://developers.google.com/places/ios-api/) to find places near your current location and displays them in a table view. Details about each place can be found by clicking on each table view cell.

SVPullToRefresh (https://github.com/samvermette/SVPullToRefresh) was used to allow reloading of nearby locations when the user moves. The app currently does not support automatic updating of nearby places based on changes in the user's location.
